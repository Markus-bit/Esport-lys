# hue-bridge-model

This is a JavaScript/Node.js module that provides the base level model and data objects that are used
to provide wrappers around the Hue Bridge objects from the Hue REST API.

This module is primarily used to provide the data objects for the [node-hue-api](https://github.com/peter-murray/node-hue-api).

## TypeScript
The code base was converted to TypeScript upon extraction from the node-hue-api library so that it is easier to maintain
the Type definitions and the actual JavaScript code.

This library is complied in to Node.js and ESM supported versions for consumption.
